1. Use RGB, HSV, HSL, and LAB color models
    a. Important Channels

        ii.  HSL -> Yellow (Saturation)
        iii. HSV -> Yellow (Saturation and Value)
        iv.  LAB -> Yellow (Ligthness and B channel) and white (Lightness) 
    b. finally combining all of them with the thresholding one to the best results
2. Understand differences between the color models and the color space
3. Sobel thresholding vs the canny edge detection model and which can can be used for the better result
4. Finalizing the code and clearing out the junk
5. Documenting the code and pushing the changes to the git
